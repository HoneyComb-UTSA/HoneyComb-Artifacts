# What is HoneyComb?
HoneyComb is a proposed approach that turns the darknet into a large-scale honeypot to enable the gathering of much-needed IoT malware forensic artifacts.


# HoneyComb-Artifacts
This particular Github repository is created to share with the security community a sample of the IoT malware artifacts gathered by HoneyComb.

# HoneyComb-Artifacts Details
In this repository, we present a sample of `Log files`, `Json files`, and `Databse files` recorded by HoneyComb during its interaction with malware-infected IoT devices in the wild:
1. Log files (contains all the recorded logs)
2. Json files (contains all the recorded interactions between HoneyComb and malware-infected IoT devices in the wild)
3. Database file (contains all the recorded packet level information)
